Welcome to the CodSoft Data Science Internship repository! Here, you will find all the tasks and projects I completed during my internship.

üìÅ Projects

1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

Description :  The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Programming Language and Libraries Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

2:  MOVIE RATING PREDICTION

Description :  Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

Programming Language and Libraries Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

3:  IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Description : The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.

Programming Language and Libraries Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

4:  SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Description : Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection

Conclusion : This systematic approach allows for the creation of a robust predictive model and the effective evaluation of its performance.

5: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Description:  Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.

Programming Language and Libraries Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, SMOTE
